A simple arcade game for [Weekly Game Jam 154](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-154) Theme: Rock Paper Scissors

Works best on mobile where you can tap and the main player moves to the horizontal position of that tap.

You also don't have to release your finger.

Keyboard and gamepad also works.

The `game.zip` is 11004 bytes, which made this a good code warmup for [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/).
